## Usage



> The steps for this challenge are broken out into the following sections:

* Import the Data (provided in the starter code)
* Prepare the Data (provided in the starter code)
* Find the Best Value for `k` Using the Original Data
* Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Data
* Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
* Find the Best Value for `k` Using the PCA Data
* Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
* Visualize and Compare the Results

> In this Challenge, you’ll assume the role of an advisor in one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. Competitors are fierce, so you want to propose a novel approach to assembling investment portfolios that are based on cryptocurrencies. Instead of basing your proposal on only returns and volatility, you want to include other factors that might impact the crypto market—leading to better performance for your portfolio.
